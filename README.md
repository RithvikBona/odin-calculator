The Odin Project - Calculator Project

Website: https://rithvikbona.github.io/odin-calculator/ 

This project is meant to showcase my javascript skills to create a calculator. This calculator allows for basic operations and exponentiation, along with decimal and sign changing support. Clear and deletion is also supported. A history bar at the top of the calculator allows the user to see their previous calculation.

I learned about button listeners and setting effective flags to dictate when to continue entering a number and when to perform an operation. I also learned about testing for edge cases, such as trying to do further operations once dividing by 0. In this case, I locked all other buttons aside from clear.
